# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Removed the historical `OpenAI-Beta: responses=experimental` header from ChatGPT backend HTTP requests and identified Responses calls as `originator: codex_backend_sdk` instead of impersonating the Rust CLI.
- Forwarded `extra_headers`, `extra_query`, and per-call `timeout` from `client.responses.create(...)` and `client.responses.parse(...)` instead of silently ignoring them.
- Rejected attempts to override protected authentication, routing, framing, or streaming headers through Responses `extra_headers`.

### Tests
- Added final-wire coverage for the prepared Responses request, including OAuth/account headers, SSE negotiation, query and timeout forwarding, absence of the historical beta header, and case-insensitive protected-header rejection.

### Documentation
- Reconciled authentication, Responses headers, retries, file uploads, and the application-level OpenAI hostname boundary with the current implementation.
- Clarified that Responses history is caller-managed, Codex Cloud tasks/turns are not ChatGPT sidebar conversations, and the SDK does not expose general ChatGPT conversation history.
- Added safe offline-versus-live test guidance and corrected runnable examples and dated backend observations.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Added typed Codex rate-limit reset credit listing and explicit idempotent consumption through `client.codex.rate_limit_reset_credits`.
- Added ChatGPT-authenticated image generation and editing through `client.images.generate(...)` and `client.images.edit(...)`, returning typed base64 image data from the Codex backend.

### Documentation
- Documented that image generation uses the ChatGPT Codex backend rather than the separately billed Platform image endpoint, and that consuming reset credits mutates account quota state.
- Documented the verified Codex JSON image-edit contract using ordinary URLs or base64 data URLs.

### Tests
- Added behavioral coverage for credit payloads, redemption validation, image request construction, defaults, URL normalization, and typed responses; verified read-only credit listing plus real image generation and editing against the authenticated backend.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- Detect anonymous audio buffers by their file signature before ChatGPT transcription uploads, correcting filenames and MIME types when callers provide misleading generic names such as `audio.mp3` for WAV data.
- Restored reliable `AIClient.audio_to_text(bytes)` integration with `/backend-api/transcribe` without requiring callers to understand multipart backend constraints.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for WAV buffers carrying an incorrect `.mp3` name and verified the complete Codex Agent transcription path against the real ChatGPT backend.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- Routed `client.audio.transcriptions.create(...)` through the ChatGPT-native `/backend-api/transcribe` endpoint instead of the billable Platform `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint.
- Preserved the OpenAI-shaped `json` and `text` response behavior used by Codex Agent while rejecting unsupported streaming, timestamp, speaker, chunking, SRT, and VTT options explicitly.
- Added a reusable raw ChatGPT multipart request helper to the client transport.

### Documentation
- Clarified that embeddings still use the OpenAI Platform endpoint and its developer-account quota, while batch transcription now uses the authenticated ChatGPT backend.

### Tests
- Added coverage for ChatGPT transcription routing, account authentication headers, text responses, and unsupported parameters.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Added typed Realtime call results through `RealtimeCallResponse.answer_sdp` and `RealtimeCallResponse.call_id`.
- Added Codex AVAS session payload support, including automatic removal of the server-generated session `id` and the required `quicksilver` query parameters.

### Documentation
- Documented that the ChatGPT-authenticated Codex WebRTC route is experimental and rollout-dependent, while the public Realtime WebSocket route still requires a developer API key.

### Tests
- Added coverage for SDP response parsing, call ID validation, AVAS payload construction, and invalid session payloads.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Added Voice v2 WebSocket headers through `client.realtime.websocket_headers(...)`, using the API key stored by OAuth when available or `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a fallback.
- Added `authenticate(force=True)` for explicit interactive reauthentication.

### Changed
- ChatGPT OAuth now attempts the same optional ID-token-to-API-key exchange as Codex CLI and persists the result in the official `OPENAI_API_KEY` auth field.
- Removed the legacy `request_api_key` authentication option; API-key acquisition is now an internal OAuth concern and never prevents regular Codex login.

### Tests
- Added coverage for forced authentication and Realtime credential selection/error behavior.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- Preserved `usage` on `client.responses.compact(...)` results so `CompactedResponse` exposes backend token accounting.

### Tests
- Added coverage to verify compact responses retain `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and `total_tokens`.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Added `authenticate(interactive=False)` to allow non-interactive credential checks without triggering the browser OAuth flow.
- Added `client.authenticated` for simple auth-state introspection.
- Added `client.account_info()` to expose safe non-secret account metadata (`authenticated`, `account_id`, `email`, `plan_type`).

### Documentation
- Documented the non-interactive authentication helpers in `README.md`.
