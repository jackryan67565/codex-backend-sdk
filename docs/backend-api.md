# Codex Backend API — Reverse-Engineering Notes

Sourced from live observation, this repository's implementation, and
`codex-rs` source (`openai/codex`).
Document revised: 2026-08-09. Model, plan, and availability statements remain
dated observations unless explicitly tied to current source.

The maintained SDK contract is [README.md](../README.md). This document also
records observed routes that are not exposed by the SDK; those routes are
labeled explicitly.

---

## Base URLs

| Path style | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Codex API (direct) | `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex` |
| WHAM (account/quota) | `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api` |
| OpenAI API with Codex OAuth | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| OAuth issuer | `https://auth.openai.com` |

Implemented SDK HTTP requests require HTTPS on port 443 and an approved
hostname suffix: `chatgpt.com`, `openai.com`, `oaiusercontent.com`, or
`oaistatic.com`. Environment proxies and redirects are disabled. This is an
application-level policy, not operating-system egress enforcement. The OAuth
system browser and any caller-owned WebSocket transport are outside the SDK's
Requests sessions.

---

## Authentication headers

Authenticated ChatGPT backend requests carry:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
ChatGPT-Account-ID: <account_id>
originator: codex_cli_rs
```

Normal HTTP requests do not send the historical
`OpenAI-Beta: responses=experimental` header. Responses requests additionally
identify this adapter with `originator: codex_backend_sdk` and send
`Accept: text/event-stream`; other maintained ChatGPT routes retain their
previous originator. The backend streams SSE even when the SDK collects those
events into a non-streaming return value.

- `access_token` and `account_id` come from `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, defaulting
  to `~/.codex/auth.json` (written by the OAuth flow).
- `account_id` is extracted from the `id_token` JWT claim `https://api.openai.com/auth` → `chatgpt_account_id`.
- Tokens are obtained via ChatGPT OAuth 2.0 + PKCE (issuer: `https://auth.openai.com`, client_id: `app_EMoamEEZ73f0CkXaXp7hrann`).
- OpenAI Platform requests use only the appropriate bearer authorization plus
  endpoint-specific headers. OAuth token exchanges use their form/JSON headers,
  and signed file uploads use storage-specific headers without ChatGPT tokens.
- `POST /v1/embeddings` accepts the ChatGPT OAuth access token in observed
  Pro-plan tests. Batch transcription was moved to the current
  `/backend-api/transcribe` route; the former Platform transcription route is
  retained only in version history.

## Codex API endpoints

### `GET /backend-api/codex/models`

List models available to this account.

**SDK method**: `client.models.list()` / `client.models.retrieve(model)`

**Query params**
- `client_version` — Codex CLI protocol/client version string (e.g. `"0.130.0"`).

**Response** — JSON `{ "models": [ ModelObject, … ] }`

The backend may include an `ETag` header. The SDK preserves it as
`client.models.list().etag`.

Key fields per model:
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | string | Model identifier, e.g. `"gpt-5.2"`, `"gpt-5.4"` |
| `display_name` | string | |
| `context_window` | int | |
| `supported_in_api` | bool | Backend exposure metadata; not an SDK usability gate |
| `supports_reasoning_summaries` | bool | Whether `reasoning.summary` is supported |
| `support_verbosity` | bool | |
| `default_verbosity` | string? | |
| `default_reasoning_level` | string? | |
| `supported_reasoning_levels` | list | `[{ effort, description }]` |
| `auto_compact_token_limit` | int? | Token count that triggers auto-compaction |
| `prefer_websockets` | bool | |
| `input_modalities` | list | e.g. `["text", "image"]` |
| `available_in_plans` | list | e.g. `["plus", "pro", "enterprise"]` |
| `base_instructions` | string | Default system prompt baked into the model |
| `priority` | int | SDK currently sorts models by ascending value |

**Observed snapshot**

- One account exposed `gpt-5.4` for inference while reporting
  `supported_in_api: false`.
- The same observation reported `supports_reasoning_summaries: true` and
  `supported_in_api: true` for `gpt-5.2`.

Model IDs and flags vary by account and rollout. Query `client.models.list()`;
do not treat this snapshot as an availability guarantee. The list is cached per
client for five minutes, and `list(force_refresh=True)` bypasses that cache.
`retrieve(model)` searches the list rather than calling a model-specific route.
The compatibility arguments `extra_headers`, `extra_query`, `extra_body`, and
`timeout` are accepted by both model methods but currently ignored.

---

### `POST /backend-api/codex/responses`

Main inference endpoint. **Stream-only** — `stream: true` is mandatory; the
backend never returns a non-streaming HTTP response. In SDK calls,
`client.responses.create(..., stream=False)` still returns a collected
`Response`, but this is assembled client-side from the SSE stream.

**SDK method**: `client.responses.create(...)`

`client.responses.parse(..., text_format=MyPydanticModel)` is a convenience
wrapper over the same endpoint. It populates `text.format` with a strict JSON
schema and returns `ParsedResponse`.

The OpenAI-shaped `extra_headers`, `extra_query`, and per-call `timeout`
arguments are forwarded to this endpoint. For Responses only, header names are
checked case-insensitively and callers cannot override `Authorization`,
`ChatGPT-Account-ID`, `originator`, `OpenAI-Beta`, `Host`, `Content-Length`, or
the required `Accept` header. Do not assume this protected-header policy applies
to other resources that accept `extra_headers`.

**Request body** (JSON):

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "stream": true,
  "tools": [],
  "tool_choice": "none",
  "parallel_tool_calls": false,
  "input": [ /* ResponseItem list */ ],
  "instructions": "",
  "store": false,
  "include": []
}
```

`reasoning`, `text`, `service_tier`, and `prompt_cache_key` are added only when
the caller supplies them.

Key fields:
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | Model slug |
| `stream` | bool | Must be `true` |
| `input` | list | ResponseItem list (user messages, history, tool results) |
| `instructions` | string | System prompt |
| `tools` | list | OpenAI function-call format |
| `tool_choice` | string\|object | `"auto"` / `"none"` / `"required"` / `{"type":"function","name":"..."}` |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | bool | |
| `reasoning` | object? | `{ "effort": "minimal"\|"low"\|"medium"\|"high"\|"xhigh", "summary": "concise"\|"detailed"\|"auto" }` |
| `text.format` | object | `{"type": "text"}` or `{"type": "json_schema", "name": "...", "schema": {...}, "strict": true}` |
| `store` | bool | Must be `false` |
| `service_tier` | string? | `"priority"` is accepted; `"auto"` is rejected |
| `prompt_cache_key` | string? | Caller-selected stable key; UUID syntax is not enforced |
| `include` | list? | Include extra fields, e.g. `["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` |

**Prompt cache retention**

`prompt_cache_retention` is not accepted as a request parameter on this
endpoint. Sending either `"in_memory"` or `"24h"` returns:

```json
{"detail":"Unsupported parameter: prompt_cache_retention"}
```

Successful SSE events currently still report:

```json
"prompt_cache_retention": "24h"
```

This appears to be a backend-selected Codex policy rather than a client
configuration knob. It is important for long sessions: with stable
instructions, tools, schemas, and early conversation prefix, the 24h retention
can preserve prompt-cache hits across much longer idle gaps than default
in-memory prompt caching.

**Web search** (supplied directly in `tools`):
```json
{ "tools": [{ "type": "web_search_preview", "search_context_size": "medium" }] }
```

The SDK has no `cached`/`live` search-mode convenience parameter and performs
no local validation of backend search modes.

**Response** — SSE stream. Each event: `data: { ... }\n\n`

SSE event types:
| `type` field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `response.output_item.added` | New output item started |
| `response.output_item.done` | Output item complete (message, reasoning, function_call, …) |
| `response.output_text.delta` | Incremental text chunk (`delta`) |
| `response.content_part.delta` | Incremental text chunk (`delta.text`) |
| `response.content_part.done` | Text part finished |
| `response.function_call_arguments.delta` | Tool call argument chunk |
| `response.function_call_arguments.done` | Tool call complete |
| `response.completed` | Stream finished; carries `usage` |
| `response.failed` | Stream ended with error; carries `error.code` and `error.message` |

**Reasoning delivery**  
Reasoning content is NOT delivered as streaming deltas. It arrives as a completed `response.output_item.done` event with `item.type = "reasoning"`:
```json
{
  "type": "response.output_item.done",
  "item": {
    "type": "reasoning",
    "summary": [{ "type": "summary_text", "text": "..." }],
    "encrypted_content": "<opaque blob>"
  }
}
```
- `summary` is populated only when `reasoning.summary` is set and the model supports it.
- `encrypted_content` is always present; treat as opaque.

**Usage object** (in `response.completed`):
```json
{
  "input_tokens": 123,
  "output_tokens": 45,
  "output_tokens_details": { "reasoning_tokens": 30 },
  "total_tokens": 168
}
```

---

### `POST /backend-api/codex/responses/compact`

Compact a long conversation into an encrypted summary the model can still read.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "input": [ /* full conversation history */ ],
  "instructions": "Compact the conversation.",
  "tools": [],
  "parallel_tool_calls": false,
  "reasoning": { "effort": "medium" },
  "service_tier": "priority",
  "prompt_cache_key": "cache-key",
  "text": { "verbosity": "low" }
}
```

**Response** — synchronous JSON (not SSE):
```json
{
  "id": "resp_...",
  "output": [
    { "type": "message", "role": "user", ... },
    { "type": "compaction_summary", "encrypted_content": "..." },
    ...
  ]
}
```
- `output` replaces the original history; pass it as `input` in subsequent calls.
- The `compaction_summary` item is opaque on the client side.

**SDK method**: `client.responses.compact(...)`

---

### `POST /backend-api/codex/memories/trace_summarize`

Summarize traces into persistent memories.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.memories.trace_summarize(...)`

**Status**: Supported as a typed helper. May return `403 Forbidden` depending
on plan/account capabilities.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "traces": [
    {
      "id": "trace_1",
      "metadata": { "source_path": "memory.jsonl" },
      "items": [ /* normalized trace items */ ]
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": { "effort": "low" }
}
```

**Response** — JSON `{ "output": [...] }`, exposed by the SDK as
`MemorySummarizeResponse`.

---

### `POST /backend-api/codex/realtime/calls`

Realtime audio/video call initiation.

**SDK method**: `client.realtime.calls.create(...)`

**Status**: Experimental and rollout-dependent. The SDK follows the Codex
client protocol:

- plain SDP offer: `client.realtime.calls.create(sdp=offer_sdp)`
- AVAS SDP offer plus session payload:
  `client.realtime.calls.create(sdp=offer_sdp, session={...})`

The OAuth-authenticated ChatGPT route is not enabled for every account and may
return `404 Not Found` until Codex supplies an experimental WebRTC call base URL.
This is distinct from the public Realtime WebSocket route, which uses a
Realtime API key rather than the ChatGPT OAuth access token.

The response exposes `.answer_sdp` and `.call_id`, while preserving the binary
helpers `.content`, `.text`, `.read()`, `.iter_bytes()`, and
`.write_to_file(...)`.

---

### Realtime WebSocket helpers

The `codex-agent` realtime plugin uses OpenAI Realtime WebSocket sessions while
sharing the Codex OAuth/token store.

**SDK methods**:

- `client.realtime_websocket_url(model="gpt-realtime-1.5")`
- `client.realtime.websocket_headers(session_id="...")`

The URL helper returns:

```text
wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=...
```

The headers helper returns `Authorization: Bearer <openai_api_key>`, the Codex
originator, and the optional session id. It prefers `TokenStore.openai_api_key`
and falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Interactive ChatGPT OAuth attempts to
exchange its fresh ID token for this distinct Realtime credential and persists
it when the account is entitled to one. If that exchange is unavailable,
regular Codex OAuth continues to work but Voice v2 requires a separately
provisioned key.

---

## Embeddings and Transcription

These OpenAI-shaped resources deliberately use different upstreams. Embeddings
remain an OpenAI Platform call and consume the associated developer-account
quota. Batch transcription uses the authenticated ChatGPT backend and does not
require a developer API key.

### `POST /v1/embeddings`

**SDK method**: `client.embeddings.create(...)`

**Status**: Supported. Verified with:

```json
{
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "input": "ping",
  "dimensions": 3
}
```

The response matches the official embeddings shape:
`{ "object": "list", "data": [{ "object": "embedding", ... }], "usage": ... }`.
The request is accounted against the OpenAI Platform organization returned by
the API; ChatGPT OAuth authenticates it but does not include it in a ChatGPT
subscription.

### `POST /backend-api/transcribe`

**SDK method**: `client.audio.transcriptions.create(...)`

**Status**: Supported for non-streaming ChatGPT batch transcription. The SDK
uploads multipart audio with the OAuth bearer and `ChatGPT-Account-ID`, and
supports the `model`, `language`, `prompt`, `temperature`, and `json`/`text`
response options used by Codex Agent. Streaming, timestamps, speaker references,
chunking, SRT, and VTT are rejected locally rather than falling back to a
billable Platform endpoint. JSON format returns a typed `Transcription`;
`response_format="text"` returns a string.

### `POST /backend-api/codex/images/generations`

**SDK method**: `client.images.generate(...)`

**Status**: Supported through ChatGPT OAuth. Verified with `gpt-image-2`; the
response contains `created` and `data[].b64_json`, plus optional effective
`background`, `quality`, and `size` fields. Supported request fields mirror the
current Codex client: `prompt`, `model`, `background`, `n`, `quality`, and
`size`. This uses the Codex/ChatGPT backend rather than the OpenAI Platform
image endpoint.

### `POST /backend-api/codex/images/edits`

**SDK method**: `client.images.edit(...)`

**Status**: Supported through ChatGPT OAuth. Accepts one or more remote URLs or
`data:` URLs as `images[].image_url`, plus the same prompt/model/background/count/
quality/size controls as generation. Verified by generating a source image and
editing it through the authenticated backend.

Remote image URLs are request payload data sent to ChatGPT. This SDK does not
fetch or validate them as local network destinations.

### `POST /v1/audio/speech`

**Status**: Observed but not exposed. A malformed request reaches payload
validation, but a valid Pro-plan request currently returns `401` with missing
`api.model.audio.request` scope.

---

## WHAM endpoints

WHAM is the ChatGPT account/quota management layer, distinct from the Codex API.

### `GET /backend-api/wham/usage`

Rate limits and quota for this account. Used as the auth probe — a 200 response confirms valid tokens.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.usage()`

**Response** — JSON:
```json
{
  "plan_type": "plus",
  "rate_limit": {
    "allowed": true,
    "limit_reached": false,
    "primary_window": {
      "used_percent": 12,
      "limit_window_seconds": 3600,
      "reset_after_seconds": 2847,
      "reset_at": 1745180000
    },
    "secondary_window": { ... }
  },
  "credits": { ... },
  "additional_rate_limits": [ ... ],
  "rate_limit_reached_type": null
}
```

Known `plan_type` values: `guest`, `free`, `go`, `plus`, `pro`, `prolite`, `free_workspace`, `team`, `business`, `enterprise`, `edu`, `education`, `quorum`, `k12`, `unknown`.

Known `rate_limit_reached_type.type` values: `rate_limit_reached`, `workspace_owner_credits_depleted`, `workspace_member_credits_depleted`, `workspace_owner_usage_limit_reached`, `workspace_member_usage_limit_reached`.

---

### `GET /backend-api/codex/rate-limit-reset-credits`

**SDK method**: `client.codex.rate_limit_reset_credits.list()`

Returns a typed detail payload containing `available_count`,
`total_earned_count`, and credit rows with IDs, reset type, status, grant and
expiry timestamps, title, and description. The equivalent WHAM path is also
currently accepted by ChatGPT, but the SDK follows the active Codex client
path.

### `POST /backend-api/codex/rate-limit-reset-credits/consume`

**SDK method**: `client.codex.rate_limit_reset_credits.consume(...)`

Consumes a reset credit. `redeem_request_id` is required as the idempotency key;
`credit_id` selects a specific available credit when supplied. This mutates
account quota state and is never called implicitly by the SDK.

### `GET /backend-api/wham/config/requirements`

Fetch managed requirements/config for this account (plan-gated settings).

**SDK method**: `client.codex.config.requirements()`

**Response** — JSON config blob; schema defined in `codex-rs/cloud-requirements`.

---

### `GET /backend-api/wham/tasks/list`

List entitlement-gated Codex Cloud execution tasks.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.tasks.list(...)`

**Query params**: `limit`, `task_filter`, `environment_id`, `cursor`.

These tasks and their turn mappings are Codex Cloud execution history. They are
not ordinary ChatGPT sidebar conversations, and the SDK currently has no
resource for listing or loading general ChatGPT conversation history.

---

### `GET /backend-api/wham/tasks/{task_id}`

Get details for a specific cloud task.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.tasks.retrieve(task_id)`

Observed response includes `task`, `current_user_turn`,
`current_assistant_turn`, and `current_diff_task_turn`.

---

### `GET /backend-api/wham/tasks/{task_id}/turns`

List task turns as a mapping.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.tasks.turns.list(task_id)`

Observed response includes `turn_mapping` and `current_turn_id`.

---

### `GET /backend-api/wham/tasks/{task_id}/turns/{turn_id}/sibling_turns`

List sibling turns for a task turn.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.tasks.turns.sibling_turns(task_id, turn_id)`

---

### `GET /backend-api/wham/environments`

List Codex cloud environments for the authenticated account.

**SDK method**: `client.codex.environments.list()`

Observed response is a raw list of environment objects, including repository
metadata, network settings, permissions, and cache settings. Secrets are present
as backend metadata, not plaintext values.

---

### WebSocket: `wss://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/remote/control/server`

**Status**: Observed, not exposed or opened by this SDK.

Remote control / agent-as-a-service websocket. Observed enrollment route:

`POST /backend-api/wham/remote/control/server/enroll`

---

## ChatGPT File Uploads

### `POST /backend-api/files`

Create file upload metadata for Codex Apps/MCP file parameters.

**SDK method**: `client.files.upload(path)`

The currently observed Codex client flow is:

1. `POST /backend-api/files` with `file_name`, `file_size`, and
   `use_case: "codex"`.
2. `PUT` the file bytes to the returned signed `upload_url`.
3. `POST /backend-api/files/{file_id}/uploaded` until the backend returns
   `status: "success"`.

The SDK performs step 2 only for HTTPS URLs on approved OpenAI-operated domain
families, disables redirects, and ignores environment proxy settings. A signed
URL on any other host fails before local file bytes are read into a request. The
local upload limit is 512 MiB.

The SDK returns an `UploadedFile` object with `file_id`, canonical
`sediment://...` URI, download URL, file name, size, MIME type, and local path.
The returned download URL is opaque backend metadata; the SDK neither validates
nor fetches it.

---

## ChatGPT Account Data

These endpoints are under `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`, not
`/backend-api/codex`. They return account-level ChatGPT data and are exposed
under `client.codex` as raw dictionaries.

This surface covers memories and customization, not ChatGPT conversation
history.

### `GET /backend-api/memories`

**SDK method**: `client.codex.memories.list()`

**Status**: Supported. Returns a payload shaped like:

```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_...",
      "content": "...",
      "updated_at": "...",
      "status": "..."
    }
  ],
  "memory_max_tokens": 12000,
  "memory_num_tokens": 123
}
```

Memory items may include additional fields such as `conversation_id`,
`created_timestamp`, `gizmo_id`, `last_updated`, and `labels`.

### `GET /backend-api/user_system_messages`

**SDK method**: `client.codex.user_system_messages.retrieve()`

**Status**: Supported. Returns the raw ChatGPT customization payload, including
fields such as `enabled`, `about_user_message`, `about_model_message`,
`traits_model_message`, `disabled_tools`, and personality-related settings.

---

## Input format (ResponseItem)

Messages passed to `input`:

**User message:**
```json
{ "type": "message", "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "input_text", "text": "..." }] }
```

**Assistant message:**
```json
{ "type": "message", "role": "assistant", "content": [{ "type": "output_text", "text": "..." }] }
```

**Image input (URL):**
```json
{ "type": "input_image", "image_url": "https://..." }
```

**Image input (base64):**
```json
{ "type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." }
```

**Tool call (function_call):**
Returned verbatim from `response.output_item.done` with `item.type = "function_call"`. Append raw item to history.

**Tool result:**
```json
{ "type": "function_call_output", "call_id": "call_...", "output": "..." }
```

---

## Known limitations / quirks

- `stream: true` is **mandatory** — there is no sync endpoint.
- `store: false` is **mandatory**; `store: true` returns a 400.
- `prompt_cache_retention` is server-selected (`"24h"` observed in SSE events)
  and rejected if sent in the request body.
- Public Responses API fields such as `temperature`, `top_p`,
  `max_output_tokens`, `metadata`, `user`, `safety_identifier`, `truncation`,
  penalties, and `previous_response_id` are rejected as unsupported parameters.
- `tool_choice` field is **required** when `tools` is non-empty (omitting it causes a 400).
- `memories/trace_summarize` returned 403 on one observed Plus account;
  availability is account- and rollout-dependent.
- Reasoning tokens are billed separately from output tokens.
- The `reasoning.summary` field only populates for models with `supports_reasoning_summaries: true` (e.g. `gpt-5.2`); on other models the field is absent and only `encrypted_content` is present.
- Model IDs, plan availability, and `supported_in_api` values are
  account-specific observations. Query `client.models.list()` rather than
  treating examples here as an availability guarantee.

## Retry boundaries

The shared HTTP transport retries `429`, `5xx`, timeout, and connection
failures, including for POST requests. SSE failures after response consumption
begins are not resumed. OAuth token exchanges and the signed upload `PUT` bypass
the shared retry loop; file finalization has a separate polling loop for
`status: "retry"`.
